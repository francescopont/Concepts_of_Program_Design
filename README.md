# Concepts of Program Design
This repo contains the assignments of the course Concepts of Program Design at Utrecht University, academic year 2019/2020, in the folder concepts_of_program-design. All the code is written in Haskell.

# Description
The first assignment consists of the implementation of a semantic evaluator for a statically typed and explicitly typed language, MinHs,  using an environment semantics, including support for recursion and closures. The only considered types are Int, Bool, functions with one parameter, and lists of integers. Functions are then first class citizens. The concrete syntax of MinHS is mainly the same as in Haskell. For more details, refer to the specs of the assignment.

In the second assignment, the same language is considered to be statically and implicitly typed, to have a polymorphic type system and aggregate data structures. The assignment consists of the implementation of a type inference pass for this language. For more details, refer to the specs of the assignment.

The third assignment consists of a systematic review of the Java language: history, characterization of the language, strengths and weaknesses of the language.

The folder a_bit_of_playing contains  just some examples to get acquainted with the Haskell language.
